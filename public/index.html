        <p> Being a very visual person, I need a way to "lay out" my life in front of me in order to have a sense of self. </p>
        <p> And since social media nowadays just sucks, my growing rage and disgust for these platforms led me to lose said sense of self, since i could not bring myself to use them (still struggling), so it was either continuing to feel like im in a black hole or doing something about it, looking for solutions.</p>
        <p> So essentially, I built this to visualize my life in a more convenient way since no social media app has all the features I want. </p>
        <p> Im also planning on letting out the voices in the form of essays from time to time cause I dont wanna cram my <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> too much.</p>
        <p> Stick around maybe I'm actually gonna write and design on here and this is not gonna end up as yet another failed attempt at keeping a hobby. </p>
